Not every episode of shaking or loss of awareness is necessarily a seizure. Several different conditions can produce episodes of shaking or loss of consciousness, for example, syncopes, migraines, transient ischemic attacks, and sleep disorders. To evaluate an episode it should be taken into account:

- **Precipitating factors**: what were the circumstances before the event?
- **Prodrome**: what did the patient experience prior to the event?
- **Time course**: how long last the seizure?
- **Stereotypy**: do the events happen the same way every time?
- **Behavior during factors**
- **Nature or recovery**: the recovery was made with prolonged confusion or was it rapid?

In order to arrive at the proper diagnosis, it is important to also considerer other non-epileptic etiologies [1](#a).

### What is a seizure?

An epileptic seizure is a transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due
to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain. [3]

### What types of seizures are? [5]
Seizures are usually named by onset:
Generalized onset: originating from and rapidly engaging networks of both brain hemispheres
Focal onset: originating within the networks of one hemisphere of the brain. Focal onsets can be further classified by the level of awareness (aware vs. impaired awareness) and motor vs. non-motor
A seizure may be “unclassified” if there is not enough information or inability to place it in other categories.

### What causes seizures?
It is very important to identify the origin of a seizure for treatment and prognostication. Some of the epilepsies may fit into more than one category. [2]
Seizures can be caused by:
Genetic causes: around 15% of people with epilepsy have a first-degree relative with epilepsy. The risk of suffering epilepsy is three times higher if a first-degree relative has epilepsy. Genetic epilepsies account for 15-20% of all epilepsies. [6]
Metabolic causes: epilepsy is common in disorders from inborn errors of metabolism (for example vitamin B responsive disorders or disorders of amino acid). Many metabolic epilepsies are also considered epileptic encephalopathies, in which the the seizures may contribute to severe cognitive and behavioral impairments. [2]
Structural: some structural problems are associated with seizures, for example, malformations of cortical development, hippocampal sclerosis, tuberous sclerosis complex, brain tumors, vascular events (hypoxic-ischemic injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke) and traumatic brain injury.
Central nervous system infections: some infections are related to the development of epilepsy (meningitis, encephalitis, neurocysticercosis and cerebral abscess). [2]
Autoimmune causes: some autoimmune diseases as multiple sclerosis and Ramussen encephalitis can provoque seizures. [2]

### What is a provoked seizure?
Provoked seizures occur as the result of the seizure threshold being transiently lowered by some disturbance. They do not count toward a diagnosis of epilepsy. Some causes of provoked seizures could be medications, recreational drugs, alcohol withdrawal, barbiturate or benzodiazepine withdrawal and metabolic. [1]

### What is epilepsy?
Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures, and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. The definition of epilepsy requires the occurrence of at least one epileptic seizure. [3]
This means, that epilepsy is a disease of the brain defined by any of the following conditions [4]:
At least two unprovoked (or reflex) seizures occurring in less than 24 hours
One unprovoked (or reflex) seizure and a probability of further seizures similar to the general recurrence risk (at least 60%) after two unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years
Diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome

How can epilepsy be diagnosed? [2]
Any of the following criteria can be used to diagnose epilepsy.
At least two unprovoked (or reflex) seizures occurring in less than 24 hours
One unprovoked (or reflex) seizure and a probability of further seizures similar to the general recurrence risk (at least 60%) after two unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years
Diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome: although epilepsy is largely a clinical diagnosis, EEG may help to establish a reliable diagnosis.

What are the risk factors for Epilepsy? [2]
Some of the risk factors for epilepsy are:
Complex febrile seizures of long duration (more than 15 min) or more than one seizure in 24 hours
Family history of epilepsy
Head trauma with loss of consciousness
Meningitis or encephalitis
Perinatal distress

### How can seizures be treated? [7]
#### Antiepileptic drugs:

[Taken from 7]
Seizures are treated with antiepileptic drugs (AED). For this is important to identify the type of epilepsy (generalized vs. focal). The is narrow spectrum AEDs are indicated for focal epilepsies but may exacerbate genetic generalized epilepsies. Some of the medications used in generalized epilepsy are benzodiazepines, felbamate, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, perampanel, rufinamide, topiramate, valproic acid, and zonisamide. On the other hand, the drugs used for focal epilepsies are carbamazepine, eslicarbazepine, ezogabine, gabapentin, lacosamide, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, pregabalin, tiagabine.
Some antiepileptic drugs may cause serious life-threatening reactions, especially worsening depression and suicidal ideation.
Vagus nerve stimulation:
Additionally, other types of treatment can be used to fight seizures. For example, the vagus nerve stimulation. This stimulation consists of placing subcutaneously a small pulse generator in the left chest with a lead attached to the left vagus nerve. This nerve is stimulated at regular intervals.



#### Responsive neurostimulation:

Consist of a closed-loop system that continuously records the electrocorticographic activity and provides responsive electrical stimulation when certain patterns are detected. The neuroestimulator should be implanted cranially and connected to one or two depth or subdural cortical strip leads.


[Taken from 7]
#### Deep Brain Stimulation

Bilateral electrodes are implanted in the anterior nucleus of the thalamus. It has proved to be effective, but its mechanism is unknown. It can help with reducing the seizure severity, improvement in the quality of life and neurological measures.
